# I have created two variables with unique names and meaningful tags, this will allow anyone that reads this code to better understand the code that is written.
# placing the strings in 'XXXX', "XXXX" could have been used too.
# Variables
first_name = 'lewis'
last_name = 'Cleveland'
# the print function tells the console what I want to be printed to the screen, I have concatenated the words together with the + and the '_' sto create a space between the names
